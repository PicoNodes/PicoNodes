* Instruduction
 The piconode-switch is designed to be used with the piconode kit and is compatible with the piconode kits motherboard. It is meant to give a more handson and visual understanding of the communication between the piconodes. This node is not programmable by the user but is already running a program designed to be used with the motherboard.
* Features
The piconode-switch offers the following features:
- Four switches.
- One communication pin for communicating to the right.
* Quick start
The node is an easy applied feature for the piconode kit developed for the basic in hardware close programming and distributet systems.
* Getting started
 Follow these steps to learn how to use the piconode-led:
1. Power the motherboard
2. Place the picoode-led on a available slot on the motherboard. This slotshould also have one available slot in any direction next to the piconode-led.
3. Place th epiconode-switch on the available slot next to the piconode-led OR program a piconode to send a value of the range 1-4 in the direction of the piconode-led.
4. If you placed a switch then press one button ELSE if you palced a piconode, the piconode will send the value to the piconode-led and a LED will light up symbolizing the value recieved.
* Hardware and layout
 The hardware and the PCB-layout are available in the datasheet provided for the piconode kit.
* Power supply
 The power supply for the piconode-led is 3.3 V.
* LEDs
 THe LEDs are used to symbolize a value recieved from one of the input pins. THere are four input pins for recieving a value, one in each directino. The piconode-led will only recieve a value in the range of 1-4. If it recieves a value out of range it will discard it and no LED will light up. (Should it be able to recieve more then one direction?)
