- IDE: The graphical editor and debugger, code in `ide/picoide`
- Server: Serves the IDE, stores all data, and controls the Downloaders, code in `ide/picoserver`
- Downloader: Combined debugger and programmer, controls a single Node at a time
- Motherboard: Connects all the Nodes to each other, and supplies power and a common clock
- Node: Any component that is part of the target system, aside from the Motherboard
- NodePlug:tm:: The connector between a Node and the Motherboard
- Compute Node: A programmable Node running user-supplied code
- PicoASM: The language Compute Nodes are programmed in
- Peripheral Node: Any Node that is not a Compute Node
- PicoTalk: The protocol for communication between Nodes

* Why `Downloader`?

So far we've called these Programmers or Programmer Nodes, but both of these are confusing. As Mark mentioned, calling them `Programmer`s cheapens the act of /programming/ (which is what the users will be doing the rest of the time). They're also not Nodes, since they don't use the NodePlug, and don't use the Node<->Node protocol.

Other options:

- Controller
- Debugger
