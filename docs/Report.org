* Introduction

The goal of this project outcome is to provide a hands-on physical
pedagogical education platform for schools. The platform will be
tailored towards \ac{Skolverket}'s new curriculum and learning goals for the subjects Computational
Thinking and Programming\cite{KTek2017} (which will take effect from July 2018\cite{HesslingPaues17}). The
platform is aimed towards teaching parallel programming and distributed systems using a
custom assembler language.

** Research Questions
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: questions
   :END:

The study has examined the following questions:

1. Implementation of a platform to teach the basics of bare metal programming to students.
2. Evaluation of the pedagogical usefulness of the platform and how to implement
   the idea to motivate students.

** Delimitation

The project is limited to 2.5 months, so the product will not be ready for the market in this time. Rather, the
project aims to build up a ground for a future product that can be represented on the market. It will be a simple
prototype, primarily so that the students can try it out.

Further development opportunities will be mentioned in Chapter [[#further_opportunities]].

The product will be targeted towards students in eighth grade, both students who have programmed before and students
who are new to it.

Because of the limited time frame we have not undergone compliance testing (such as for RF and EMC emissions), which
would be required for commercialization.

* Background

The digitalization of our society is moving quickly, and we all want to keep up with it. This puts a lot of pressure on the schools
to teach programming and computational thinking in the education. For this reason \ac{Skolverket} is adding computational thinking
to the primary school curriculum.

# Source for this claim
Several countries have implemented programming into their schools, and this is creating market demand for tools to
use in the teaching process. Many products to help teach this subject already exist, but they are generally all focused
on providing a simple environment for programming a single isolated computer. This is great, but we believe it's just
as important to understand how multiple computers interact in networks, as well as how low-level assembler programming
works.

** Computational thinking in Swedish schools

\ac{Skolverket} is adopting programming and computational thinking in schools and has set up goals for the schools to implement.

Computational thinking is stated by Linköping's University\cite{HeintzMannila}, to be a process of problem-solving which includes:

- Formulating a problem in such a way that it becomes possible to use computers to solve it.
- Breaking down complex problems into smaller parts.
- Finding repeating patterns and reusing them.
- Creating algorithms to automate the solution of a problem.
- Logically organizing and analyzing data.
- Represent data through abstractions such as models and simulations.
- Identifying, analyzing, and implementing possible solutions to find the most
  effective one.
- To generalize and use this kind of problem-solving process on other
  kinds of problems.

According to Heintz and Mannila\cite{HeintzMannila}, computing in schools should
have three key stages:

1. Ages 5-6: algorithms and instructions, to create and debug simple
   programs, with a focus on logical thinking.
2. Ages 7-11: Develop and debug greater problems
   with given goals and use programming concept with variables, sequences,
   selection and repetition.
3. Ages 12-14: Two or more programming languages, Boolean logic, binary numbers,
   connection between the program and hardware.

This project is directed to be used by student in the ages of 14-15, and fits the
last key stage quite well.

One important thing to consider in the process of teaching computational thinking
and programming is to have very clear guidance and considerations for the teachers,
who need to understand the learning concept fully to be able to teach it.

# Find the primary source or scrap

A study made in 2017 by Lärarnas Riksförbund show that 8 of 10 math teachers with students in the 8:th and
9:th grade feel insecure about teaching programming, and 54% of the teachers don't have any experience
programming at all.
# Lärarnas Riksförbund, letar källa..

Another challenge is that the teachers are anxious to develop new learning resources, and feel insecure
when dealing with new and unfamiliar teaching material.\Cite{Bower17} For these reasons the project
will keep the teachers, and how to prepare them for using the platform's tools, in mind.

The UI should be kept as simple as possible, so that it is easy to use with few setup steps, letting
them focus on the important part: the programming.

*** Prior Art

So far, "educational" programming has mostly taken one of two tracks: "toy" languages and environments
that are designed to be visually exciting (such as Scratch\cite{Scratch}), or disposable limited computers
(see Raspberry Pi\cite{RaspberryPi} and BBC micro:bit\cite{MicroBit}).

We've tried to go in a slightly different route, inspired by Zachtronics Industries' games Shenzhen
I/O\cite{ShenzhenIO} and TIS-100\cite{TIS100}. Instead of giving them a single computer or \ac{MCU}
for the whole project, we give them a whole bunch of /extremely/ limited \acp{MCU}, in order to force
them to think about splitting their projects a long time before a traditional approach would have. To
compensate for this, we've also provided a simplified way to communicate between them, without having
to worry about more complicated concerns, such as bits, timing, and clock skew.

Compared to the Zachtronics games, building this as a physical kit required us to consider practicality
to a bigger degree. Shenzhen I/O's free-form \ac{PCB} layout system gives the user an extra degree of freedom,
but requiring the user to wait for (and pay for) the \acp{PCB} to be re-manufactured after each design
change would have been very stifling. Alternately, you could have a pre-manufactured \ac{PCB} but let
the user set up connections as they pleased, using jumper wires. However, we also rejected this design
due to space constraints and the messy design it would have produced.

** Purpose

Improving the digital literacy of school students, in Sweden and abroad.

** Goal

To develop a basic prototype of a educational platform to be used in the Swedish schools.

** Ethics and Sustainability

It's important to make sure that the product is produced in a sustainable manner. For example, care should be taken to avoid
conflict minerals, child labor, and so on.

It should also be secure enough that it can't be snooped on, or abused by malware and botnets. Currently all traffic between
the downloaders and the server is encrypted and authenticated, and reasonable care has been taken to ensure that the
communication is handled safely. However, the security has not been professionally audited, and it has been designed
under the assumption that it will be used in an isolated network.

The server also doesn't currently authenticate users.

Finally, as an educational product we believe that it's very important that the students have the freedom to tinker with it freely,
and that they have access to all the design materials. Any educational product is ultimately about setting up "illusions" so that
the user can focus on what's important, but it's just as vital that they are allowed to peek behind the curtain once they feel
ready.

* Method

# State the problem and underlying assumption.

\ac{Skolverket} is about to implement new learning goals for computational thinking in July 2018. Their vision for
2020 is that every student has developed an adequate competence for digital technology
https://liu.se/cetis/konferenser/documents-tis2017/m2-3-datalogiskt-tankande.pdf).
# Try to find primary source?

The primary question for this thesis project is: "How can you implement computational thinking
for an parallel and hardware-close programming?". To try to answer this we developed a platform to
be used in schools when teaching programming. The evaluation of the platform was based on letting
school students and teachers play around with a prototype, and then letting them fill out a questionnaire
about their experience.

** Targeted user and school selection

The product is directed to students in 8:th grade. The platform is aiming to be a good base for students without programming practice as well to be challenging enough
on a higher level for a more experienced programmer. The manual is in English so the students must understand English well.
Initially we wanted to feedback from as diverse a set of schools as possible but because of the lack of interest from the schools, only one
volunteered to evaluate the prototype. To try to gather as much data as possible, family members was asked to participate for the evaluation of the prototype.

** Evaluation

We used a questionnaire to get an evaluation from the students testing the prototype.

The data are gathered by questionnaires with two sections. One section is about their experience in general with encounter programming and
section two is about their experience with the prototype. This is to evaluate what disposition the students can have about programming and
if we change that disposition. The teachers and student are handed  a similar questionnaire but with straighten questions towards the use of the product
teaching/learning.
# should we have the questions in the report?
The data will be used to evaluate the product and for suggestions to future work.

** Specific research tools and strategies

The product will have the UI designed in the browser so the user wont be fixed to one platform. This way
either a mobile phone or a laptop can be used for programming the micro-controllers. The MCU of our choice
is stm32f030f4p6. This MCU is chosen because it got enough I/Os and memory space for the application and
is reasonable cheep. This MCUs are also popular to program in Rust which make it easier to find documentation
and support. At least 8 I/O is needed. UART communication(two pins for TX and RX), communications between
the MCUs(4 pins), external clock source and coarse grained synchronization clock. A server will be provided
by Inicio which contains the drivers for communicating between the platforms and the compiler for the bytecode.

** Programming Languages

Rust is used to program the MCU. The MCU of our choice is
stm32f030f4p6. C is also an option and can be preferred
if anyone would like to use IDE such as EWARM or STM32Cube to generate
initiallisation code but this IDE is not suported by Linux and is why we are using Rust. Rust is also better from a safety
perspective because it is harder to read something from more then one thread
and it verifies pointers are still alive when they are used so you will not be
able to keep a pointer beyond their objects lifetime. Rust also suits very well
with our Bytecode model since our abstract sytax tree contains different legal
values depending on the instruction. Alot of different IDE can be used for Rust,
in this project we will use Emacs because both Scala program and the report is
written here.

The homepage is programmed in Scala. Scala is very practical for not changing
languege when writing the client and server. This makes it easier when communicating
between the server and client.

** CAD and CAM tools

In the first stages of the project it is prefered to be more flexible for changes.
For this reason a breadboard and jumpingwires are used to test the design before
making the final one. The MCU-moduels is made in a routermill so a breakout board
can be made for the MCU pins to match the breadboard.

* Result

** Communication
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: comm
   :END:

We decided to use a mesh interconnect (see Figure [[fig:mesh-grid]]), where each node is connected
to its direct neighbors. This is relatively simple to route, has no chance of collisions, and
# Explain absolute vs relative addressing in background?
requires no form of absolute addressing.

*** PicoTalk
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: picotalk
    :END:

The Nodes communicate using a custom asynchronous single-wire protocol called PicoTalk. We did this because we wanted to use a
mesh interconnect instead of a shared bus, and because we didn't have the hardware support or pin count to connect each pair
using a more common protocol, such as UART. It is /not/ a master/slave protocol, the transmitter/receiver roles are negotiated
for each message.

Because it is asynchronous, each side must provide its own clock. The clocks must be calibrated to 10kHz. The clocks are also
reset for each message, in order to avoid clock skew corruption.

The communication line is held high while idle by a 4.7KΩ pull-up resistor on the motherboard. Thus all participants should be configured in
open drain mode, with their internal pull-ups disabled.

PicoTalk can be divided into four primary stages, as shown in Figure [[fig:picotalk-diagram]]: Idle, Handshake, Preamble, and Message.

In the Idle stage neither party is trying to transmit anything. When a party wants to transmit they enter the Handshake stage,
by transmitting two low ticks. They then wait for a single low tick in response. If no response is heard after three ticks then
the transmitter restarts the Handshake stage. The preamble stage is 5 ticks of alternating high and low signals. This is used to
ensure that the clocks are calibrated correctly. Afterwards the message (a single byte) is sent, least significant bit first.
The bus then returns to the Idle stage.

** Node Design

There are a few design elements that are common to all nodes, to ensure that they can all be placed in any position
on the motherboard, and so that they can all be debugged using the same tools.

Using the LED node (Figure [[fig:led-node-pcb-front]]) as an example, they all share the following features:

#+CAPTION: The front side of the LED Node PCB
#+LABEL: fig:led-node-pcb-front
#+ATTR_LATEX: :width 4cm
[[./led-node-pcb-front.png]]

- They are all 30.48x27.94mm
- The angled corner marks the correct orientation
- The grips (in the top and bottom) help you to remove the nodes from a packed motherboard
- The pins all follow this layout (from left to right):
  - Top row:
    - 3.3V power (VDD)
    - SWCLK (used for debugging only, normally NC)
    - Ground
    - SWDIO (used for debugging only, normally NC)
    - Reset (active low)
  - Bottom row:
    - Down
    - Left
    - Up
    - Right
- They are all powered by STM32F030F4P6 MCUs

** Nodes

We designed and fabricated three different Nodes: a LED display Node (see Figure [[fig:led-node-pcb-front]]), a button
input Node (see Figure [[fig:button-node-pcb-front]]), and a programmable compute Node (see Figure
[[fig:compute-node-pcb-front]]) to connect them. They are documented further in their respective appendices (see Appendix
[[#appendix-piconode-led]], [[#appendix-piconode-switch]], and [[#appendix-piconode-compute]], respectively).

** Motherboard

We designed a motherboard based on the [[#comm][communication layout]] mentioned earlier, visualized in Figure [[fig:motherboard-pcb-front]].
It also provides power, ground, and a reset control to all the nodes.

** PicoASM

We designed a simple assembler dialect, based on Shenzhen I/O's assembler language\cite{ShenzhenIO}. It is documented
in further detail in Appendix [[#appendix-piconode-compute]]. Contrary to typical x86 desktop processors it does not have
any jump or branch instructions. Instead any instruction can be associated with a conditional flag, which is set by
our test instructions. An example PicoASM program is given in Listing [[lst:picoasm-prng]], which acts as a simple "wheel
of fortune", given a Button Node on the left side, and a LED Node on the right side.

** PicoIDE

We provided a web-based editor called PicoIDE, which allows you to edit programs and upload them to Compute nodes. It
be seen in Figure [[fig:picoide-screenshot]]. It is intended that this runs on a server on the same network as the
Downloaders.

*** Security

Downloaders communication is encrypted using TLS, with verification of client and server certificates. Browser
communication is not encrypted by default, but it is recommended that this is done using a reverse proxy, such
as Nginx. There is currently no user authentication system.

* Analysis

During the project we have developed an educational platform, with the aim that the platform can be used by teachers to late primary school to teach programming.

We also wanted to get an evaluation of the prototype, from surveys and observation in different schools. A prototype was developed, with some time left for an evauation.
However, the teachers' lack of interest and time constraints were limiting factors. In the end, one teacher offered to try out PicoNodes. The evaluation went better
than we had anticipated; most of the students were motivated by PicoNodes, and wanted to learn more programming afterwards.

** Evaluation Of The Final Product

To motivate students, the prototype is designed to be very simple, with little end user setup required. We designed it to be easy to get started, but with the opportunity
to develop challenging tasks for more advanced students to practice with.

We had designed a few exercises, but due to various misunderstandings we weren't able to test them. We had planned to let 2-4 students test it in pairs, but
due to time constraints we only had 1 kit ready, while 8 students showed up. This meant that we had to improvise, and they ended up passing the kit around the table, while
the others were either observing or preparing their own programs on their tablets.

** Development Issues

Some miscalculations where made during the development process.

*** PicoTalk Timing

For example, our original PicoTalk implementation had severe
clock skew issues, where the transmitter and receiver would start synchronized, but slowly go out of sync during the message.
To solve this we ended up requiring the receiver to resynchronize their internal clock for each message (see also Chapter
[[#picotalk]]). This also limited the speeds that the nodes could communicate at. Another way to solve this could have been a
shared clock bus, equalizing clock skew between the nodes. However, that would have led to a higher \ac{BOM} cost, and a more
complicated \ac{PCB} design. Also, we liked having an uneven number of pins, since that also acted as a guide to orient the Node
correctly in its socket.

*** Conflicting special-use pins

Another issue was that the downloader refused to boot when connected to more than 2 Nodes. At first we thought this was a power issue
(see Chapter [[#power_usage]]), but this didn't solve the issue. Instead, it turns out that the ESP32 pin we had used to control node reset
was used to detect the logic voltage level, expecting a low input for \SI{3.3}{\V} logic. Since this is the default it has a pull-down
resistor. At the same time, the node reset is active-low, and so has a built-in pull-up resistor so that device is usable when the pin
is floating. When more than 2 Nodes were connected the pull-ups would overpower the ESP32's pull-down. To fix this we attached a stronger
pull-down to the pin, which the ESP would easily overpower once running, and activate the Nodes.

*** Power Usage
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: power_usage
    :END:

We had also miscalculated the power usage of the setup. Initially we relied on the Huzzah32's built-in voltage regulator. However,
that voltage regulator (AP2112) is only specified for loads below \SI{600}{\mA}. After recalculating our worst-case estimates we realized that
our total load is described by Equations [[eqn:power-consumption-symbolic-n-pullups]] through [[eqn:power-consumption-symbolic-i-total]]. In
these formulas, \(W_{node}\) is the number of Node columns, \(H_{node}\) is the number of Node rows, \(I_{node}\) is the maximum current
draw of each Node, \(I_{downloader}\) is the maximum current draw of the Downloader, and \(R_{pullup}\) is the resistance of the PicoTalk
pull-up resistors.

#+LABEL: eqn:power-consumption-symbolic-n-pullups
\begin{equation}
N_{pullups} = W_{node} * H_{node} * 2 + W_{node} + H_{node}
\end{equation}

#+LABEL: eqn:power-consumption-symbolic-i-pullups
\begin{equation}
I_{pullups} = \frac{U}{R_{pullup}} * N_{pullups}
\end{equation}

#+LABEL: eqn:power-consumption-symbolic-i-nodes
\begin{equation}
I_{nodes} = W_{node} * H_{node} * I_{node}
\end{equation}

#+LABEL: eqn:power-consumption-symbolic-i-board
\begin{equation}
I_{board} = I_{pullups} + I_{nodes}
\end{equation}

#+LABEL: eqn:power-consumption-symbolic-i-total
\begin{equation}
I_{total} = I_{board} + I_{downloader}
\end{equation}

Plugging in our numbers, this gives us a board power usage of \SI{1.1}{\A}, and a total power usage of \SI{1.6}{\A}. Once we had realized
how far out of spec this was, we set up a separate voltage regulator. However, since we discovered this after we had already made our motherboard,
we also made a mezzanine board with the voltage regulation logic.

** Node Selection

Another problem we had was defining what Nodes to make. We obviously needed a programmable Node, but we also wanted some way to let the user affect the computation,
and to let them see the result.

At first we wanted to make a digit display node, similar to a Lixie display\cite{Lixie}. However, due to both space and time constraints we ended up making a simplified
4-LED Node instead.

* Further Opportunities

** More Nodes

The possibilities with this product is restricted to your imagination. Nodes can be developed
for special visual effects, or for specific purposes such as games or exercises. One request
we got was a TNT Node, and LEDs on the Compute Node that light while communicating. LEDs in the
communication stream was something we had already thought of, but the idea was dropped at the time
due to a lack of \ac{IO} pins.

** More Exercises

Another area of interest would be to create more exercises. It could also be interesting to have
LEGO-style tutorials for building specific projects.

** User Management

The current approach of letting everyone access everything might get chaotic in a classroom environment.
Instead, files and downloaders should be linked to specific users.

** Studies

It would be useful to have a more in-depth study of the platform's efficacy.

** Compliance

Before the product is taken to market it must be tested with the regards to the relevant compliance standards, such as CE, RoHS, UL, and FCC.
There should also be a formal security audit.
