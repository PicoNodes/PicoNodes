* Introduction
The goal of this project outcome is to provide a "hands on", physical 
and pedalogical education plattform for the schools. The plattform will 
the new learning outcomes that is taking its place in june 2018 for the
subjects computational thinking and programming. The plattform is directed
for hardware close and parallel programming, using a own developed assembler 
like language to teach computational thinking.
** Background
*** 
*** Computational thinking in the Swedish scools
Computational thinking is, stated by Lindköpings university, to be
a process of problemsolving which includes:
- Formulating a problem in a way that makes it possible to use computers to solve it.
- Break down complex problems in smaller parts.
- Find repeating patterns and use them.
- Creates algortims to automate the solution of a problem.
- Logical orginaze and analyze data.
- Represent data throuh abstractions like models and simulation.
- Identify, analyze and implement possible solutions to find the most 
effective one in a combination of steps and resources.
- To generalise and use this kind of problemsolving processes on other 
kind of problems.
Computing in scools will have three key stages,
1. In the years 5-6: algorithms and intructions, to create and debugg simple
programs and a focus will lay on logical thinking.
2. The years 7-11: Develop and debugg greather problems
with given goals and use programmingconcept with variables, sekvens, 
selection and repetition.
3. The years 12-14: Two or more programminglanguages, bools logic, binaries,
connection between program and hardware.

This project is directed to be used by student in the ages of 14-15, fitting the 
last key stage very well.
The importance of computational thinking and programming in scools is stated by Mannila and Heintz 
from Linköpings universitet to be the problemsolving processes which include describe, analyse 
and state the problem in a way so computers can help solving the problem. This ability will 
evolve skills in handling coplex problems, perseverence when working on big problems,
tolerans for ambiguity, ability to handle open stated problems and ability to communicate
and cooperate with others https://www.ida.liu.se/~frehe08/FredrikHeintzLindaMannila-skolverket-20150302.pdf.
One importans thing to consider in the process of educating computational thinking
and programming is to have very clear guidence and conciderations for the teachers,
who need to understand the learning concept fully to be able to teach it.
In a inquiry made by Microsoft and CAS, 68% of the teachers is worried that the 
students have more understanding for the subject then they do and that 81%
of the teachers wish for more agile training and material for the subject https://www.ida.liu.se/~frehe08/FredrikHeintzLindaMannila-skolverket-20150302.pdf.
For this reason will the project have a focus on the teachers and how to prepare them 
to use the tools the plattform provide. This will be in form of documents of concept,
tutorials?, ...(this might fit some where else)

** Problem
*** Questions
The study have examend following question:
1. How to implement the new outcomes for computational thinking
2. Implementatin of a plattform to teach students to do hardware close programming
3. Evaluation of the pedalogicalness of the plattform and how you can implement 
the idea to motivate students.

** Methodology / Methods
State the problem and underlying assumption.
The National Agency for Education in Sweden are about to implement outcomes for
computational thinking in june 2018. Their vision for 2020, is that every student have 
developed an adequate competence for digital tecnology 
https://liu.se/cetis/konferenser/documents-tis2017/m2-3-datalogiskt-tankande.pdf). 
The question formulation in this thesis report is how can you implement computational thinking 
for an parallel and hardware close programming. For the project, a plattform was developed to 
be used as a tool in the scools education when teaching programming and was iterative developed
during the last 3 weeks of the project from evaluation research. The avaluation of the plattform was based on research 
with questionairs to the the teachers and students and feedback after they checked out the products
prototypes. The questionair is formed so the answers can give us a foundations for developing a
pedalogical and motivating tool the student can use to achieve the outcomes for computational thinking.
 
*** data selection

*** Tools
*** Analysing the data and procedcures
*** Specific research tools and strategies
The product will have the UI designed in the browser so the user wont be fixed to one plattform. This way eather a mobilephone or a laptop can be used for programming the microcontrollers. The MCU of our choice is stm32f030f4p6. This MCU is chosen because it got enough I/Os and memoryspace for the application and is reasonable cheep. This MCUs are also popular to program in Rust which make it easier to find documentation and support. At least 8 I/O is needed. UART communication(two pins for Tx and Rx), communications between the MCUs(4 pins), external clocksource and coarsegrain syncronization clock. A server will be provided by Inicio which contains the drivers for communicating between the plattforms and the compiler for the bytecode.

*** IDE and programming langueges 

Rust is used to program the MCU. The MCU of our choice for the is 
stm32f030f4p6. C is also an option and can be prefered 
if anyone would like to use IDE such as EWARM or STM32Cube to generate 
initiallisation code but is not suported by Linux. Rust is better from a safety 
perspective because it is harder to read something from more then one thread 
and it verifies pointers are still alive when they are used so you will not be 
able to keep a pointer beyond their objects lifetime. Rust also suits very well 
with our Bytecode model since our abstract sytax tree contains different legal 
values depending on the instruction. Alot of different IDE can be used for Rust,
in this project we will use Emacs because both Scala program and the report is 
written here. 

The homepage is programmed in Scala. Scala is very practical for not changing 
languege when writing the client and server. This makes it easier when communicating 
between the server and client.

*** CAD and CAM tools
In the first stages of the project it is prefered to be more flexible for changes. 
For this reason a breadboard and jumpingwires are used to test the design before 
making the final one. The MCU-moduels is made in a router  mill so a breakout board
can be made for the MCU pins to match the breadboard. DipTrace is used for designing 
and routing the PCBs.
