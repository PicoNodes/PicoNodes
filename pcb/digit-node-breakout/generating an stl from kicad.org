* The problem

KiCad has a very nice 3D viewer, but limited export options. It would be nice if we could use
this as a guide for designing the enclosure. Sadly, the export feature is thoroughly broken
at the moment.

I've managed to get OpenSCAD to import a distant relative of KiCad's 3d model, but sadly it's
a pretty manual process. Nevertheless, here goes...

* The process

** Get the model out of KiCad

This bit is fairly simple.

- Open the PCB in Pcbnew
- Go to ~File~ -> ~Export~ -> ~VRML~
- Make sure ~Plain PCB (no copper or silk)~ is enabled
- Export!

** Enabling the 3D printer toolbox

This only needs to be done the first time.

- Open Blender
- Open ~User Preferences~
- Go to ~Add-ons~
- Enable ~Mesh: 3D Print Toolbox~
- ~Save User Settings~
- Restart Blender

** Cleaning up the model

- Open Blender
- Delete the default cube (~Del~, ~1~)
- Import the VRML file (~File~ -> ~Import~ -> ~X3D Extensible 3D (.x3d/.wrl)~)
- Export as STL (~File~ -> ~Export~ -> ~STL~)
  - This merges everything into one Blender object
- Open a new file (~Ctrl+n~, ~1~)
- Delete the default cube again (~Del~, ~1~)
- Import the STL file (~File~ -> ~Import~ -> ~STL~)
- Select the imported object
- Open the ~3D Printing~ panel
- Click ~Make Manifold~
- Set the threshold to ~0.04~
- Click ~Make Manifold~ repeatedly, until it reports that there were no more changes
- Export as STL again
